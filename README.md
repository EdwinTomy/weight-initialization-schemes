## weight-initialization-schemes
Creating weight initializations based on characteristics found on subnetworks produced by effective pruning algorithms and implementing output normalization. 

### Project Files
#### 1. generate_results
The python files you can run to actually run the models and generate the data. All the files are runnable on the moment except mnist_nocnn_change_weights_IGNOREEEE.py
 
#### 2. initialization_techniques
Where the different weight initialization schemes are defined

#### 3. models
Where the different neural networks that were tested are defined

#### 4. results
Where the numpy arrays that contain the results from generate_results are stored

#### 5. utils
Some utility functions, including loading datasets

#### 6. analyzing_results
Files that were used to create the charts using data from results. Currently empty since I used collab for creating the files, will reformat it into here in the future. Eitherway, the charts are in the presentation.
